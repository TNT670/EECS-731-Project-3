# EECS-731-Project-3

This project demonstrates the use of clustering. Several movie datasets are utilized, and the aim is to predict similar movies given an input feature based on ratings and tags given by users.

KMeans is the algorithm tested in this project, and some feature engineering was utilized to develop input data that would work well with the tools utilized here.

Check the Jupyter notebook in notebooks/ to learn more.
